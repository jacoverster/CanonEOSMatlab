# CanonEOSMatlab

Tested using Canon EOS Rebel SL1

Requires .NET framework 4.51 or higher

Semi-functional so far, tempermental connection, based on digiCamControl C# source and Jonathan Hoy's initial matlab script (his uses .NET 4.0, which was incompatible with my system [Windows 8.1, .NET 4.51])

Jonathan Hoy's inital version of this: (capable of only auto-mode image capture)
